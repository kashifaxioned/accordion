          <h2 class="accordion-heading">What is HTML?</h2>
          <p class="accordion-info">HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page
            and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted
            points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic
            understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>

          <h2 class="accordion-heading">What is CSS</h2>
          <p class="accordion-info">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how
            does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also
            covers some key terms about the language.</p>

          <h2 class="accordion-heading">What is JavaScript?</h2>
          <p class="accordion-info">JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement
            complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static
            information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D
            graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the
            third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in
            much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p>

          <h2 class="accordion-heading">What is jQuery?</h2>
          <p class="accordion-info">jQuery is an open source JavaScript library that simplifies the interactions between
            an HTML/CSS document, or more precisely the Document Object Model (DOM), and JavaScript.
            Elaborating the terms, jQuery simplifies HTML document traversing and manipulation, browser event handling,
            DOM animations, Ajax interactions, and cross-browser JavaScript development.</p>
